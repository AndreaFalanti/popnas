STRUCTURE
A .ini campaign configuration file, containing all regression techniques /
hypers / datasets (training, hyper selection, validation), is provided.
Everything happens in sequence_data_processing.
First, all pre-processing steps are process()d, then model_building.process()
is called:
1) experiment generators are created
2) experiment configurations are generated by them
3) models are train()d
4) results.Results() collects results of all regressors
5) results.collect_data() evaluates the regressors
6) results.get_bests() chooses the best regressor
7) it is re-trained and re-evaluated on the whole dataset.


OBSERVATIONS
* in data_preparation/product.py: product name of columns "x1" and "x2" would
  be "x1_x2", so it deletes column "x1_x2" if it already exists
* in data_preparation/random_splitting.py: weird nomenclature, it checks for
  the existence of "training" but then it uses an inputted starting_set?
* why is Normalization class not used, and a few lines perform normalization
  instead? maybe to use custom scalers?
